silly way to see what builds i have through csv

I didnt bother providing a way to use this with a user prompt. You can either look by using two teams...or two player names...maybe ill move that to a user prompt but for now just bring it into your IDE and then modify those vals in the main class...i also didnt add a file selector option so its defaulted to my home dir right now so that will have to change too
